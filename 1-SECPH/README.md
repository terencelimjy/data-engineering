# 1/SECPH

This folder contains materials and projects from my first semester as a Bachelor of Computer Science (Data Engineering) student at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).

## 📘 Courses
- Discrete Structure (SECI1013)
- Programming Technique 1 (SECJ1013)
- Digital Logic (SECR1013)
- Technology and Information Systems (SECP1513)

## 📌 Projects
- Digital Logic – Lift Controller System
- Technology and Information System - Low-fidelity prototype for AthletIQ

This semester helped me build a foundation in logical reasoning, programming, and digital system design, which are important for my future studies in data engineering.
